//  1.	Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
//     1a.	Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array 
//     •	Do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically, 
//     •	ages[7] – ages[0] is not allowed!

//     1b.	Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic. (works for arrays of different lengths).
//     1c.	Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age.
